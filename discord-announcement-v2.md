# ESMC SDK — The Iron Man Suit for Claude Code

> *"Claude Code is Tony Stark. ESMC is the suit. Same genius, better execution."*

**The Problem:**
Every session, Claude forgets. You rebuild context. You re-explain your codebase. Tokens burn, projects drift.

**The Solution:**
ESMC is the cognitive enhancement layer that makes Claude Code remember everything.

## What It Does

**Persistent Memory** — Your project, patterns, and preferences stay across sessions

**Token Efficiency** — `/seed` saves your full context in ~2.5k tokens (vs `/compact`'s 7-8k)

**5-Component Intelligence** — Parallel mesh analysis for better reasoning (PIU/DKI/UIP/PCA/REASON)

**Standards Enforcement** — Fewer regressions, no more "patches that break other things"

## The Reality Check: `/seed` vs `/compact`

| Feature | `/seed` (ESMC) | `/compact` (Claude) |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| Scope | Full window | Fragments |
| Token cost | 2.5k–3k | 7k–8k |
| Cross-session | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Structure preserved | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Partial |

## Why I Built This

I was burning hundreds of thousands of tokens every day. Same explanations. Same corrections. Same drift.

Three months later: ESMC emerged.

The entire SDK — and the website — was **built using ESMC itself. In one day.**

## Tiers

**FREE** — `/seed`, persistent memory, basic intelligence
*Eliminates daily context rebuilding*

**PRO** — Mesh orchestration, standards enforcement, architectural consistency
*Your code stops repeating mistakes*

**MAX** — Full cognitive partner mode, cross-project recall, predictive assistance
*Claude learns your rhythm*
