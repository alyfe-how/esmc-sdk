# ESMC SDK — Persistent Memory & Intelligence Layer for Claude Code

**The Problem We All Know:**
Every session, Claude forgets. You rebuild context. You re-explain your codebase. You burn tokens just getting back to where you were.

**ESMC fixes this.**

---

## What It Does

ESMC-SDK is a cognitive enhancement layer that gives Claude Code:

- **Persistent memory across sessions** — Claude remembers your project, your patterns, your preferences
- **5-component mesh intelligence** — Parallel analysis for better reasoning
- **Token efficiency** — `/seed` saves your full context in ~2.5k tokens vs `/compact`'s fragmented 7-8k
- **Standards enforcement** — Fewer regressions, fewer "patches that break other things"

## The `/seed` vs `/compact` Reality

| Feature | `/seed` (ESMC) | `/compact` (Claude) |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| Scope | Full window | Fragments |
| Token cost | 2.5k–3k | 7k–8k |
| Cross-session | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Structure preserved | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Partial |

---

## Why This Exists

I was burning hundreds of thousands of tokens rebuilding state every day. Same explanations. Same corrections. Same drift.

Three months of iteration later: ESMC emerged.

The entire SDK — and the website — was built using ESMC itself. **In one day.**

## Tiers

**FREE** — `/seed`, persistent memory, basic intelligence (eliminates daily context rebuilding)

**PRO** — Mesh orchestration, standards enforcement, architectural consistency

**MAX** — Full cognitive partner mode, cross-project recall, predictive assistance
